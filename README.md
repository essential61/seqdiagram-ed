# seqdiagram-ed
seqdiagram-ed is a tool to produce UML 2.0 Sequence Diagrams. It uses Javascript, HTML and XSLT and runs completely in the browser. 
It is hosted at [https://essential61.github.io/seqdiagram-ed/](https://essential61.github.io/seqdiagram-ed).

The examples.js file lists a number of examples described using the xml language created for this application. If anyone has some more examples I would be happy to add them.
