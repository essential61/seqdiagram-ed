<h3> Load File </h3>
<p> To load a previously saved file from your PC, click 'Load File' to open a file browser and select the file you would like to open. </p>

<h3> Load Example </h3>
<p> Click 'Load Example' to open an example .uml file. This example shows how to create some of the constructs you may wish to render on your sequence diagram. When creating your own sequence diagram you can either start from scratch or you may find it more convenient to alter the example file. </p>

<h3> Help </h3>

<h2> Diagram Editor Toolbar</h2>
<p> The diagram editor toolbar is located on the left-side of the screen. Alternatively exising items can be edited by clicking on them. A selected item will be highlighted in blue. </p>

<p> Message Spacing: Scale the t-axis between 20-30 px. </p>
<p> Max t: Set the number of time increments shown on Sequence Diagram. No units are specified for the time increments, but the passage of time is in a downward direction. e.g. a message at t=3 occurs after a message at t=2 and will be positioned lower down on the diagram.</p>
<p> Font Size: Set the font size between 8-16 pt. </p>

<h3> Lifelines </h3>

<p> Message Text: Add text describing the message.</p>
<p> Message t: Enter the time the message occurs.</p>
<p> Show response: Tickbox available if 'Synchronous' message type selected. Display the 'Response Text' and 'Response t' fields.</p>

<p>Top t:</p>
<p>Bottom t:</p> 
<p> Label width: Available if the (SD) frame type is selected. The width of the label corresponds to the (no. of lifelines) it encompases. </p>
